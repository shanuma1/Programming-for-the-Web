it is imperative that all work turned in by each student reflect only
his or her individual effort.  Any attempt to collaborate on the
answer to assigned work like homeworks, projects or exams will
minimally result in your letter grade for the course being dropped by
one position: i.e. an <samp data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:9:33">A-</samp> will become a <samp data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:9:52">B+</samp> and a <samp data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:9:63">B</samp> will become a
<samp data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:10:11">B-</samp>.  This penalty will be imposed in order to be fair to the vast
majority of students who are turning in work based solely on their
individual efforts.
</p><ul data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:15:0"><li data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:15:0"><p data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:15:4">Discussing material covered in class or even the questions on
an assignment is encouraged.  However, you are <strong data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:15:117">not</strong> permitted to
discuss the <strong data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:15:152">answers</strong> to any of the questions.
</p></li><li data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:19:0"><p data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:19:4">For homeworks, you are encouraged to use external resources like
the WWW or the library.  However, your answer should always
acknowledge and cite these external sources.
</p></li><li data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:23:0"><p data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:23:4">If an answer or portion of an answer is taken verbatim from an
external source, then it must be clearly indicated.
</p></li><li data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:26:0"><p data-coord="academic-honesty-policy.umt:26:4">If you do the work for an assignment and let a friend copy from
that assignment, you will also be penalized.
