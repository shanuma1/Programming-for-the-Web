const BACKGROUND = `
  This question deals with two aspects of JavaScript:

    + *Associativity and precedence of arithmetic operators*.  The
      ."multiplicative" operators .~*~, .~/~ and .~%~ are left-associative
      and have higher precedence than the ."additive" operators .~+~, 
      .~-~ (which too are left associative).  Hence 
      .~#{a} + #{b} * #{c} % #{d}~ parenthesizes as 
      .~#{a} + ((#{b} * #{c}) % #{d})~.

    + The .~%~ operator which computes the remainder.  It is important to
      to realize that in JavaScript the result always has the sign of
      the dividend; hence .~(#{c} % #{d})~ evaluates to .~#{c%d}~.

      Note that the operation of the .~%~ operation differs between
      different programming languages.  Differences arise when an
      operand is negative; also, some languages use it for "modulo"
      rather than remainder.  For details, see  
      .<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation> "this
      Wikipedia article".
